# Discord Pong
This is a simple implementation of pong using PixiJS. The goal is to be able to create multiplayer games of pong using a NodeJS backend and a Discord bot. The Discord bot should create a link that both players can follow to join the game. 

## Usage 
### Basic Pong
Run the index.html in the pong folder on a http server. This can be done using the Live Server plugin for VSCode. 
There are a couple variables that can be configured in game.js.
